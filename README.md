## Problem Statement:
Evaluating innovative ideas can be a time-consuming process, with challenges in identifying valuable solutions and distinguishing them from suboptimal or lazy pitches. CheckAI addresses these issues by leveraging generative AI to automate idea screening, scoring, and filtering, providing a comprehensive and efficient solution for idea evaluation.

## Objectives:
- Automate the screening process for innovative ideas using generative AI.
- Assign scores based on user-defined metrics to facilitate fair and efficient evaluations.
- Identify and flag suboptimal ideas to save evaluator time.
- Recognize ambitious moonshots for a comprehensive assessment.
- Allow users to customize evaluation criteria for relevance to specific needs.


## Technologies Used:
- OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo-1106
- Flask

## Data Types and Sources:
- User-provided problem-solution pairs.
- Prompt engineering for guiding the generative AI model.
- Iterative testing with the provided dataset for prompt improvement.
- Neutral language transformation step to mitigate model biases.

## Key Features:
### Automated Evaluation:
Automatically score and filter ideas based on user-defined metrics.

### Lazy Idea Detection:
Identify and flag suboptimal ideas, saving time for human evaluators.

### Moonshot Recognition:
Highlight ambitious and groundbreaking ideas for further consideration.

### Customizable Criteria:
Allow users to define metrics, descriptions, and importance levels for evaluations.
